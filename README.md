## How It Works

Commands are available as `/project:command-name` in Claude Code. Each command follows a structured workflow that Claude executes automatically, ensuring consistent and thorough results across different projects.

**Example workflow:**
- `/project:code-review` analyzes your entire codebase for quality, security, and performance
- `/project:create-feature dashboard` plans, implements, and tests a new dashboard feature
- `/project:fix-issue 123` systematically resolves GitHub issue #123 with testing

## Common Workflows

**New Feature Development:**
```bash
/project:code-review                    # Assess current state
/project:create-feature user-dashboard  # Implement feature
/project:security-audit                 # Verify security
```

**Bug Fixing:**
```bash
/project:fix-issue 456                  # Fix the specific issue
/project:code-review                    # Verify fix quality
```

**Code Maintenance:**
```bash
/project:dependency-audit               # Check for outdated dependencies
/project:performance-audit              # Identify bottlenecks
/project:refactor-code legacy-module    # Improve problematic areas
```
