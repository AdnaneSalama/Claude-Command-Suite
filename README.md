./install.sh --list

# Show help
./install.sh --help
```

### Manual Installation

#### Method 1: Project-Specific Installation

This method adds the commands to a specific project directory, making them available as `/project:command-name` when working in that project.

1. **Navigate to Your Project:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```

2. **Create Claude Commands Directory:**
   ```bash
   # Create the .claude/commands directory structure
   mkdir -p .claude/commands
   ```

3. **Copy the Command Files:**  
   ```bash
   # Copy all command files from this repository
   cp /path/to/claude-rules/.claude/commands/*.md ./.claude/commands/
   
   # Or if you cloned this repo, copy from the local path:
   cp ./.claude/commands/*.md ./.claude/commands/
   ```

4. **Verify Installation:**
   ```bash
   # Check that all commands were copied
   ls -la .claude/commands/
   
   # You should see:
   # architecture-review.md
   # code-review.md
   # create-feature.md
   # debug-error.md
   # dependency-audit.md
   # fix-issue.md
   # optimize-build.md
   # performance-audit.md
   # refactor-code.md
   # security-audit.md
   ```

#### Method 2: Personal Commands Installation

This method makes the commands available as `/user:command-name` across all your projects.

1. **Create Personal Commands Directory:**
   ```bash
   # Create personal commands directory
   mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands
   ```

2. **Copy Command Files:**
   ```bash
   # Copy command files to personal directory
   cp /path/to/claude-rules/.claude/commands/*.md ~/.claude/commands/
   ```

#### Method 3: Symbolic Links (for Development)

If you want to keep the commands updated with this repository:

1. **Create Symbolic Link:**
   ```bash
   # In your project directory (for project commands)
   ln -s /path/to/claude-rules/.claude ./.claude
   
   # Or for personal commands:
   ln -s /path/to/claude-rules/.claude/commands ~/.claude/commands
   ```

### Verification and Testing

1. **Test Command Detection:**
   ```bash
   # Start Claude Code in your project directory  
   claude code
   
   # Type / to see available slash commands
   # You should see your custom commands listed as:
   # /project:architecture-review
   # /project:code-review
   # /project:create-feature
   # etc.
   ```

2. **Test a Simple Command:**
   ```bash
   # In Claude Code, try a basic command:
   /project:code-review
   
   # Claude should recognize the command and begin the code review workflow
   ```

### Configuration Requirements
