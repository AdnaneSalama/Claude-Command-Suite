# Claude Code Custom Slash Commands
> **Inspired by Anthropic's Claude Code Best Practices**: These custom commands are designed following the principles and recommendations outlined in [Anthropic's Claude Code Best Practices](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices) to maximize effectiveness and provide structured workflows for software development.

Custom slash commands for Claude Code that provide structured workflows for common software development tasks. Get comprehensive analysis, feature development, and code maintenance with simple `/project:command-name` commands.

## Quick Start

1. **Install the commands:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/qdhenry/Claude-Command-Suite.git
   cd claude-rules
   chmod +x install.sh
   ./install.sh
   ```

2. **Start using commands:**
   ```bash
   claude code
   /project:code-review           # Review your entire codebase
   /project:create-feature login  # Build a new feature
   /project:security-audit        # Check for security issues
   ```

## Available Commands

### üîç Analysis Commands
- `/project:architecture-review` - Analyze system architecture and design patterns
- `/project:code-review` - Complete code quality and security review
- `/project:security-audit` - Security vulnerability assessment
- `/project:performance-audit` - Find performance bottlenecks
- `/project:dependency-audit` - Check dependency security and updates

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Commands
- `/project:create-feature` - Complete feature development workflow
- `/project:fix-issue` - Structured GitHub issue resolution
- `/project:refactor-code` - Safe refactoring with testing
- `/project:debug-error` - Systematic debugging approach
- `/project:optimize-build` - Build system improvements

## How It Works

Commands are available as `/project:command-name` in Claude Code. Each command follows a structured workflow that Claude executes automatically, ensuring consistent and thorough results across different projects.

**Example workflow:**
- `/project:code-review` analyzes your entire codebase for quality, security, and performance
- `/project:create-feature dashboard` plans, implements, and tests a new dashboard feature
- `/project:fix-issue 123` systematically resolves GitHub issue #123 with testing

## Common Workflows

**New Feature Development:**
```bash
/project:code-review                    # Assess current state
/project:create-feature user-dashboard  # Implement feature
/project:security-audit                 # Verify security
```

**Bug Fixing:**
```bash
/project:fix-issue 456                  # Fix the specific issue
/project:code-review                    # Verify fix quality
```

**Code Maintenance:**
```bash
/project:dependency-audit               # Check for outdated dependencies
/project:performance-audit              # Identify bottlenecks
/project:refactor-code legacy-module    # Improve problematic areas
```
